    What is the difference between PUT and POST?
    PUT modifies data. POST saves it in the backend.

2. Why does react create index.js and app.js?
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50493069/why-does-create-react-app-creates-both-app-js-and-index-js
    "index.js is the traditional [ENTRY POINT]."

    "App.js on the other hand [merely functions as the FIRST COMPONENT] of the react app because every view and component are handled with hierarchy in React,
     where <App /> is the top most component in the hierarchy. This gives you the feel that you maintain hierarchy in your code starting from 
     App.js."

3. Do I need to use classes in React anymore?
    No. According to the authority below, 'hooks' remain the modern preference above classes for structuring your React app.
    https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_class.asp
    "With the addition of Hooks, Function components are now almost equivalent to Class components. The differences are so minor that you will 
    probably never need to use a Class component in React.
    Even though Function components are preferred, there are no current plans on removing Class components from React."

4. How does one implement Axios content in React?

5. The following error rears its ugly head once again:
    "webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
    This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it."

    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46239109/axios-version-package-json
    You may need to uninstall axios first, but the command "npm install axios@0.26.1" seemed to fix it for me.

6. This is for later: Integrate POSTGRESQL with FLASK:
    https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-a-postgresql-database-in-a-flask-application

7. I capitalized the user object in the constructor for the takeinput class. It caused an error on lines 74+ because
    the interpreter/compiler could no longer recognize the user object. Object naming conventions appear to be 
    case sensitive in react.

8. I'm testing a different author's method for help in connecting the React to the Flask.
    https://dev.to/dev_elie/connecting-a-react-frontend-to-a-flask-backend-h1o

    I don't want to connect in the way the above other shows. I want to connect to my existing postgresql database.
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connecting-postgresql-with-sqlalchemy-in-python/
    This is where the Hibernate got really hairy. I'm hoping to keep this as simple as possible, for now.

9. What is Flask SQLAlchemy?
    https://pythonbasics.org/flask-sqlalchemy/
    It's another ORM for supposedly assisting with managing SQL queries and databases (equivalent to Spring's Hibernate).
    I'm done with "helpers" right now. I need to simplify this stuff and worry about adding complexity later.

10. I'm testing this young lady's code with mine to see if I can get the JSON to work.

11. A tidbit from the documentation on parser in flask_restful.
    https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reqparse.html

12. This is a little confounding as I see the CORS error pop up again despite the proxy setting in package.json and the CORS configuration
    hard-coded into the Python.
    https://www.telerik.com/blogs/dealing-with-cors-in-create-react-app
    I don't know if I need to call something in the setupProxy.js file because the way the article explains it,
    I don't see a function at all or a useEffect or hook.
