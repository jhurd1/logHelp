# logHelp

The purpose of this project is to produce a log collection help tool that can sanitize IP and MAC addresses, and other potentially sensitive data; to
gain some faimiliarity with Flask and React. Previously, the same project was built using Java, Hibernate, Postgres, 
Maven, Spring, and React, but the thing became too obtuse. I am looking to simplify and maybe integrate a database before the end of my semester in school.
